# Ford-Cars-Price-Prediction
This project is a machine learning model that predicts the price of Ford cars based on their features. The dataset used for training and testing the model is taken from Kaggle and contains information about various features of Ford cars, such as their mileage, model year, transmission type, engine size, and fuel type.

The model is built using Python and scikit-learn library. It is a regression model that uses Gradient Boosting algorithm to make predictions. The model is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics.

The project includes a Jupyter Notebook that walks through the entire process of data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and testing. The notebook also includes visualizations of the data and model results.
